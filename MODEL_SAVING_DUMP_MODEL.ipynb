       " 'hey guys i just typed a small novel below about jrtc and thought i send it out its answerin a question a friend asked about how the simulated comabt stuff works and has an example at the end excellent question about what makes the bad guys run away during an exercise the army paid grumman a shitload of cash to make laser tag stuff for us its called miles and if you ever see a picture of an army unit on an exercise you will see that the soldier is wearing a harness over his normal load bearing vestlbv the harness has four receptors on the front and four on the back in addition there is a doughnut shaped belt of receptors that goes on the kevlar helmet vehicles also have receptors mounted to them every thing from hmmvs to the tanks to the helicopters our weapons systems have transmitters on them itll look like a little box mounted on the front of the weapon the box has a pressure sensor so every time the gas from a blank round firing hits it it fires a laser beam down range if the laser beam strikes a receptor the guys harness will emit this god awful high pitched whine that lets everyone know he is downdead  and dragons bazooka like antiarmor weapons are simulated by what are called vipers same weight same size except it fires a big powerful laser that will be strong enough to activate an enemy tanks miles the armor vehicles miles game is pretty neat there are two types of kills on a tank a mobility kill and a critical kill if the viper or other weapon doesnt have a solid hit on a sensor in a critical area a mobility kill will result which means the explosion just blew the trak of the vehicle but its radios and weapons still work a critical kill means the vehicle and all inside are dead dead dead if a tank gets a critical kill the miles gear will actually shut the vehicle down and kill its radios the guy will just be drivin along and then he will hear over his radio a females voice say critical kill and the only thing that will work on the vehicle after that are the brakes so direct fire weapons systems are pretty easy to replicate target wears a receptor shooter fires a transmitter indirect fire weapons though are a bit more difficult whereas before the shooter always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a laser beam on target artillery often shoots targets that no one directly see there are two ways around this at the national training center ntc where they do all the armor against armor training they have the miles  system you have an armored motorized rifle companymrc sitting at point x i have an observer  away who with optics can see your mrc my fo calls in a fire mission based on the target description a bn  will be fired  rounds fired in  volleys as there are only  tubes in a bn the observercontrollers ocs kinna like referees will monitor the call for fire from the observer to the tubes and the ocs will take the fire mission data and plug it into their big miles computer which will take into account any errors the observer may have made and any errors the gun batteries instead of artillery companies we have artillery batteries  guns may have made when the gun batteries tell the observer that they have pulled the trigger the ocs who are always listening will pull the miles trigger what happens then is a satellite hovering above ntc will blast down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area  artillery rounds would take up it will do this  times to simulate all  volleys landing any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed as damageddestroyed at jrtc where the light fighters ie no armor assets organic to them learn to play we dont get no stinkin satellites what we do there is when a fire mission is called to the guns the ocs will monitor it and enter the data in their computers the computer will take into account any errors made by the fo and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate this grid will be passed to a fire marker which is a crazy guy with a four wheeler a gps and a god gun a hand held transmitter that fires a universal kill laser ie men to tanks and aircraft i say crazy because these guys are civilians who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target grid their average response time is   minutes which is about  minutes longer then it would be in real life so its not as cool as miles  so youll see these guys haulin ass through the woods on theses  wheelers tryin to get to their target grids on time and god help you if he pulls up into your position and no you cant haul ass if you see one comin your way cause your oc who is walkin with your unit will zap you on the spot if he sees you runnin from a fire marker ill close this bad boy with a little story oh shit there i was all good war stories gotta start with this we had started the first phase of the rotation entry into the box the box is the jrtc engagement area at  the previous night and had fought our way  km sw hand railing a road identifying minewire obstacles and eliminating the observers over watching them it was  the next morning and we were dead fkin tired and had finally reached our main objective which was a road intersection in a semi wooded area just to the south of the main air field that the rest of the brigade combat team bct was gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets there was a big triangular berm area just off the road basically the dirt walls were  ft tall  yard long we moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause at the time it looked like it would be super easy to defend which was good cause we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath plus our colt team combat observer laser team  mounted on a hmmvv fos with laser designators to guide copperheads and hellfire missiles basically vehicle killers and bradley support vehicles had just discovered boom a mine field at the intersection this was happening as we were occupying the berm so we detached a small element to go evac the casualties from the vehicles the  and a couple of joes  min later the  and his team were nailed by antipersonnel mines surrounding the mine field while trying to aid the wounded inside the vehicles at the same time a civilian truck with two redneck lookin females showed up like they were fixin to drive right on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm to stopsearch the vehicle at jrtc they employ real civilian actors to portray civilians on the battlefield or cobs because in real life there are cobs and we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at the same time so we got the  and a couple of guys down at the obstacle a cob truck right outside the berm when the co decides to go check on the obstacle by this time we had been in this big berm read trp target reference point or somethin the enemy probably has his guns laid on just waitin for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough to get a mission off for like  minutes when sure enough off in the distance we hear this vrrrrrm getting steadily louder and louder we were so tired we were basically denying the obvious theres no way hes headed for us please god dont let him be headed for us basically you had an entire company in a  yard radius which is about the same size as a  mortar impact area so there we are listening to this  wheeler get closer and closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on and get ready to haul ass of course we cant legally run until the first round impacts so this guys comes tearin down the road shoots off the road and pulls smack dab into the middle of the berm jumps off his bike and starts unloading with air burst arty simulators basically a little flare gun that pops  sticks of tnt up  ft into the air to simulate incoming rounds note these are only used when the grid is so accurate that using ground burst simulators would pose a hazard to troops basically what this told us is that we were setup the baddies were just waitin for us cause the rounds were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment so yeah this joker is poppin off airburst tnt after the first burst i yelled incoming and got up and hauled ass luckily i was close to the exit and started movin out fast because between airbursts the fire marker was just sweeping left to right with the god gun as guys were scramblin tryin to get out i got out of the berm and just kept runnin a good  because im artillery and i know what the burst radius is on these suckers i looked back and saw the infantry guys stoppin at a tree just outside the berm since there were no visible real life ground bursts they thought they were safe as i was yellin at them to keep movin an oc came out and just whacked em all  guys as the rest of the people who made it out were still runnin about  of us and we were all now  north of the berm scattered all over hell little bunches of  guys runnin to trees and collapsing just as the last of the living made it out of the berm we hear this vehicle come tearing outta the trees about  to our left and from lower ground sure enough its a dshka read dishka basically a  cal on a friggin truck bed so there this fucker is lighting us up from the left and enemy  mortar fire blastin our tail ends since the dshka was a high payoff tgt i was immediately on my net sreamin holy shit we got a dshka here grid  hellllpppp at the same time we got infantry guys tryin to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their  while trying to get two vipers together we were told by the ocs that the only thing theyve ever seen kill vehicle here with was two vipers fired at the same section of the vehicle at exactly the same time but the viper teams were scattered all over hell all this happened within about  seconds the co had seen us come tearin outta the berm and heard the dshka light up so he was on his net talkin to the kiowas scout helicopters but theyre armed so were pinned down trying to suppress this truck while dodgin  cal laser blasts since its just miles a blade of grass can deflect the laser finally the kiowas show up actually they got there respectably fast only  minutes chase the bastard down and smash him with their hellfires with  of  guys dead and one dshka down we were ready to get a little rest and then start huntin the mortar and other  dshkas that were supposed to be in the area basically we got the shit ambushed outta us it was really a pretty nice setup on the enemies part we were stupid enough to setup in an obvious terrain feature one that was no doubt on the enemys target lists so when the mortar rounds started droppin and we started pouring out of the berm there the  cal was waitin to mow down whoever didnt get killed by the arty anyways thats one of my jrtc stories and subsequently one of the largest emails ive ever written so im gonna forward it to the rest of the guys welp its about time to go get my drink on talk to yall later lawlerout hell i thought consultants had a lotta acronymshey when you guys go through these exercises what makes someone high tail out of an attack stanceie i know youre not firing live rounds at one another so how do they simulate real life scenarios also in concerns with deer hunting ill be headed down to junction our lease to pull a trophy this weekend ill probably

to neon moon  we are moving we are out of beer i jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers i am happy i return to my vehicle  we have emerged from the parking facility we make our way to my apartment and find ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him we are all going to die tonight  we have finished threequarters of the bottle of glenlivet we decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at pollyesthers ed has to pee he walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces we giggle uncontrollably and leave for pollyesthers  the pollyesthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter ive been working this door for almost a year ive been working doors in this town for almost  years and i can honestly say that i aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three sorry cant let you in we attempt to reason with him he laughs harder  we find a bar that lets us in we take two steps in the door and hear last call

      arrive at the tailgate spot awesome day not a single cloud in   the    sky about  degree        i decide that were going to kick the shit out of nebraska        i tell my first nebraska fan to go fuck himself        the ut band walks by on the way to the alamodome were on the    second floor of a twostory parking garage on the corner a couple   hundred    of us were hooting and hollering like wildmen the band doubles back   to    the street right below us and serenades us with texas fight and the eyes    of texas awesome moment        in the postserenade serendipity  grown men are bumping    chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and   certain    of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of nebraska        the nebraska band walks by on the way to the alamodome again we    hoot and holler like wildmen again the band doubles back and stops   right    below us to serenade us this time however with the nebraska fight    songs although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain    convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of nebraska        i begin the walk to the alamodome somehow managing to stuff the    traveler and  cans of beer into my pants        i am in line surrounded by nebraska fans they are taunting me i   am    taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of    nebraska i decide to challenge a particularly vocal nebraska fan to   play    what i now call and will forever be remembered as cellphone flop out    remember flop out for a dollar the rules are similar i tell this    nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop    out his cell phone right now and make plane reservations to phoenix for    the fiesta bowl and then i spoke these memorable words and not those    damn refundable tickets either you request those nonrefundable    nontransferrable sonsofbitches he backs down he is unworthy i   call    southwest airlines and buy two tickets to phoenix nonrefundable and    nontransferrable price  he is humbled he lowers his head in    shame i raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of   texas    fans i am king and these are my subjects i distribute the  beers in   my    pants to the cheering masses i rule the pregame kingdom        kickoff brimming with confidence i open the traveler and pour my    first stiffy        i notice something troubling nebraska is big nebraska is    fastnebraska is very pissed off at texas        the first quarter mercifully ends  yards total offense for    texaszero first downs for texas im still talking shit i pour another    stiffy from the traveler        four minutes to go in the first half the traveler is a dead   soldier    i buy my first  beer from the alamodome merchants while i am standing    in line a center snap nearly decapitates major applewhite and rolls out    of the end zone safety        halftime score nebraska  texas  i wish i had another   traveler        while urinating next to a nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime   i    attempt to revive the classic briceism from the south bend bathroom   hey    buddy niiiiiiiiice cock he is unamused        i buy my  and   beer from the alamodome merchants i share   my    beer with two high school girls sitting behind me surprisingly they   are    equipped with a flask full of vodka i send them off to purchase   sprites    so that we may consume their vodka i have not lost faith nebraska is a    bunch of pussies        no more vodka the girls sitting behind me have fled for their   lives    i purchase two more  beers from the alamodome merchants        score is nebraska  texas  i am beginning to lose faiththis    normally would trouble me but i am too drunk to see the football field        i call southwest airlines im sorry sir those tickets have been    confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable        i try to start a fight with every person behind the concession    counter as it turns out the alamodome has a policy that no beer can be    sold when there is less than  minutes on the game clock i am enraged   by    this policy i ask loudly why the fuck didnt you announce last call    over the fucking pa system        back in my seats i am slumped in my chair in defeat all of a    sudden the texas crowd goes absolutely nuts whazzis i mutter    awaking from my coma iz we winnig did wez scort alas the answer is    no we were not winning and we did not score the largest by far cheer    of the day from the texas faithful occurred when the handlers were   walking    back to the tunnel and bevo the texas mascot stopped to take a    gargantuan shit all over the letters s kand a in the nebraska    spelled out in their end zone i cheer wildly i pick up he empty   traveler    bottle and stick my tongue in it i am thirsty        nebraska fans are going berserk as i walk back to the truck i   would    taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but i am   too    drunk to form complete sentences with my last cognitive thought of the    evening i take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in    october they would be playing florida state for the national    championship        back in the car on the way back to austin for the basketball game        texasarizona tip off we can still salvage the day i crack open a    beer it is warm i dont care        we have stopped for gas i am hungry i go inside the storei walk    past the beer frig i notice a zima ive never had a zima i wonder if    its any good i pull a zima from the frig i twist the top off and   drink    the zima in three swallows zima sucks i replace the empty bottle in   the    frig        there is a blimpie subs in the store i walk to where the   ingredients    are where the person usually makes the sub there is no one there i   lean    over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives i eat   them    i am still hungry i lean further over the counter and grab   approximately    two pounds of pastrami i walk out of the store grunting and eating    pastrami the patrons in the store fear me i dont care        we are in south austin i have been drinking warm beer and singing    brooks and dunn tunes for over an hour my truckmate is tired of my    singing he suggests that perhaps brooks and dunn have written other   good    songs besides youre going to miss me when im gone and neon moon   and    that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit    excessive perhaps he suggests icould just let the cd play on its own   i    tell him to fuck off and restart neon moon        we arrive at the erwin center my truckmate against my loud and    profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking   garage    i tell him hes an idiot i tell him we will never get out i tell him   we    may as well pitch a fucking tent here he ignores me i think hes still    pissed about the brooks and dunn tunes i whistle neon moon loudly        i am rallying i have  warm beers stuffed in my pants were going    to kick the shit out of arizona        halftime score texas  arizona  i am pleased i go to the    bathroom to

this away    for me i take the last swig and hand it to him he is confused i    pretend im going to the bathroom but i run away giggling instead i   duck    into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me i sneak    into a large group of people and sit down the usher walks by   harmlessly    i am giggling like a little girl i crack open another can of bud light        i am lost in my haste to avoid the usher i have lost my   bearingsi    have no ticket stub i cannot find my seats texas is losing        texas is being screwed by the refs i am enraged i have cleared   out    the seats around me because i keep removing my hat and beating the    surrounding chairs with it a concerned fan asks if im ok and perhaps i    shouldnt take it so seriously i tell him to fuck off        after the fourth consecutive worst fucking call i have ever   seen    i attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects    however on this occasion i miscalculate and i thumbnail myself in my   left    eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye i am now bleeding    into my left eye and all over my shirt perhaps i think to myself   im    taking this a bit seriously

him for being a gun owner and a rock star this was his response after telling the senators about his past contributions to childrens charities and scholarship foundations which have totaled more than  million in the last  years im a bad americanthis pretty much sums it up for me i like big trucks big boats big houses and naturally pretty women i believe the money i make belongs to me and my family not some midlevel governmental functionary with a bad combover who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies i dont care about appearing compassionate i think playing with toy guns doesnt make you a killer i believe ignoring your kids and giving them prozac might i think im doing better than the homeless i dont think being a minority makes you noble or victimized i have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are different weird or make me mad this is my life to live and not necessarily up to others expectations i know what sex is and there are not varying degrees of it i dont celebrate kwanzaa but if you want to thats fine i just dont feel like everyone else should have to i believe that if you are selling me a dairy queen shake a pack of cigarettes or hotel room you should do it in english as of matter of fact if you are an american citizen you should speak english my uncles and forefathers shouldnt have had to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come disrespect ours and make us bend to your will get over it i think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry butt if youre running from them after they tell you to stop if you cant understand the word freeze or stop in english see the previous line i dont use the excuse its for the children as a shield for unpopular opinions or actions i know how to count votes and i feel much safer letting a machine with no political affiliation do a recount when needed i know what the definition of lying is and it isnt based on the word isever i dont think just because you were not born in this country you qualify for any special loan programs govt sponsored bank loans etc so you can open a hotel  trinket shop or any thing else while the indigenous peoples cant get past a high school education because they cant afford it i didnt take the initiative in inventing the internet i thought the taco bell dog was funny i want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks i believe no one ever died because of something ozzy osbourne icet or marilyn manson sang but that doesnt mean i want to listen to that crap from someone elses car when im stopped at a red light but i respect your right to i think that being a student doesnt give you any more enlightenment than working at blockbuster or jack in the box i dont want to eat or drink anything with the words light lite or fatfree on the package our soldiers did not go to some foreign country and risk their lives in vain and defend our constitution so that decades later you can tell me its a living document ever changing and is open to interpretation the guys who wrote it were light years ahead of anyone today and they meant what they said  now leave the document alone or theres going to be trouble i dont hate the rich i help the poor i know wrestling is fake ive never owned or was a slave and a large percentage of our forefathers werent wealthy enough to own one either please stop blaming me because some prior white people were idiots  and remember tons of white indian chinese and other races have been enslaved too  it was wrong for every one of them i believe a selfrighteous liberal democrat with a cause is more dangerous than a hells angel with an attitude i want to know exactly which church is it where the reverend jessie jackson preaches and what exactly is his job function i own a gun you can own a gun and any red blooded american should be allowed to own a gun but if you use it in a crime then you will serve the time i think bill gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more if it makes you mad then invent the next operating system thats better and put your name on the building ask your buddy that invented the internet to help you i dont believe in hate crime legislation even suggesting it makes me mad youre telling me that someone who is a minority gay disabled another nationality or otherwise different from the mainstream of this country has more value as a human being that i do as a white male if someone kills anyone id say that its a hate crime we dont need more laws lets enforce the ones we already have i think turkey bacon turkey beef turkey fake anything sucks i believe that it doesnt take a village to raise a childit takes a parent with the guts to stand up to the kid and spank his butt and say no when its necessary to do so ill admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was ole yeller i didnt realize dr seuss was a genius until i had a kid i will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made to keep silent because i have these beliefs and opinions i thought this country allowed me that right i will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting somebodys feelings im neither

karen leslieetsexcelrexcelr cc subject texas chili i have it on good authority that this is a true story a true texas story these are notes from an inexperienced chili taster named frank who was visiting texas from new jersey recently i was lucky enough to be the  attendee at the state fair in texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili cookoff apparently the original judge  called in sick at the last moment and i happened to be standing there when the call came in i was assured by the other two judges native texans that it would be a fun event and a true taste of texas hospitality they assured me that the chili wouldnt be all that spicy and besides they told me i could have free beer during the tasting so i accepted here are the scorecards from the event chili   mikes maniac mobster monster chili judge one a little too heavy on tomato amusing kick judge two nice smooth tomato flavor very mild frank holy shit what the hell is this stuff you could remove dried paint from your driveway with it took me two beers to put the flames out hope thats the worst one these texans are crazy chili   arthurs afterburner chili judge one smoky with a hint of pork slight jalapeno tang judge two exciting bbq flavor needs more peppers to be taken seriously frank keep this out of reach of children im not sure what i am supposed to taste besides pain i had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the heimlich maneuver they had to walkietalkie in  extra beers when they saw the look on my face chili   freds famous burn down the barn chili judge one excellent firehouse chili great kick needs more beans judge two a beanless chili a bit saltygood use of red peppers frank call the epa ive located a uranium spill my nose feels like i have been snorting drano everyone knows the routine by now barmaid pounded me on the back now my backbone is in the front part of my chest im getting shitfaced chili   bubbas black magic judge one black bean chili with almost no spice disappointing judge two hint of lime in the black beans good side dish for fish or other mild foods not much of a chili frank i felt something scraping across my tongue but was unable to taste it sally the bar maid was standing behind me with fresh refills that  lb bitch is starting to look hotjust like this nuclearwaste im eating chili   lindas lethal lip remover judge one meaty strong chili cayenne peppers freshly ground adding considerable kick very impressive judge two chili using shredded beef could use more tomato must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement frank my ears are ringing and i can no longer focus my eyes i farted and four people behind me burst into flames the contestant seemed offended when i told her that her chili had given me brain damage sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher it really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming screw those rednecks chili   veras very vegetarian variety judge one thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili good balance of spice and peppers judge two the best yet aggressive use of peppers onions and garlic superb  frank my intestines are now a straightpipe filled with gaseous sulfuric flames no one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut sally i need to wipe my ass with a snow cone chili   susans screaming sensation chili judge one a mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers judge two ho hum tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment i should note that i am worried about judge number  he appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably frank you could put a grenade in my mouth pull the pin and i wouldnt feel a damn thing ive lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water my shirt is covered with chili that slid unnoticed out of my mouth my pants are full of lavalike shit to match my damn shirt at least during the autopsy theyll know what killed me ive decided to stop breathing its too painful screw it im not getting any anyway if i need air ill just suck it in through the  hole in my stomach chili   helens mount saint chili judge one a perfect ending this is a nice blend chili safe for all not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence judge two this final entry is a good balanced chili neither mild nor hot sorry to see that most of it was lost when judge number  passed out fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself not sure if hes going to make it poor yank',\n",

am king and these are my subjects i distribute the  beers in my pants to the cheering masses i rule the pregame kingdom  kickoff brimming with confidence i open the traveler and pour my first stiffy  i notice something troubling nebraska is big nebraska is fast nebraska is very pissed off at texas  the first quarter mercifully ends  yards total offense for texas zero first downs for texas im still talking shit i pour another stiffy from the traveler  four minutes to go in the first half the traveler is a dead soldier i buy my first  beer from the alamodome merchants while i am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates major applewhite and rolls out of the end zone safety  halftime score nebraska  texas  i wish i had another traveler  while urinating next to a nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime i attempt to revive the classic briceism from the south bend bathroom hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock he is unamused  i buy my  and   beer from the alamodome merchants i share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka i send them off to purchase  sprites so that we may consume their vodka i have not lost faith nebraska is a bunch of pussies  no more vodka the girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives i purchase two more  beers from the alamodome merchants  score is nebraska  texas  i am beginning to lose faith this normally would trouble me but i am too drunk to see the football field  i call southwest airlines im sorry sir those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable  i try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter as it turns out the alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than  minutes on the game clock i am enraged by this policy i ask loudly why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking pa system  back in my seats i am slumped in my chair in defeat all of a sudden the texas crowd goes absolutely nuts whazzis i mutter awaking from my coma iz we winnig did wez scort alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score the largest by far cheer of the day from the texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters s k and a in the nebraska spelled out in their end zone i cheer wildly i pick up the empty traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it i am thirsty  nebraska fans are going berserk as i walk back to the truck i would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but i am too drunk to form complete sentences with my last cognitive thought of the evening i take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in october they would be playing florida state for the national championship  back in the car on the way back to austin for the  texasarizona tip off we can still salvage the day i crack open a beer it is warm i dont care  we have stopped for gas i am hungry i go inside the store i walk past the beer frig i notice a zima ive never had a zima i wonder if its any good i pull a zima from the frig i twist the top off and drink the zima in three swallows zima sucks i replace the empty bottle in the frig  there is a blimpie subs in the store i walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub there is no one there i lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives i eat them i am still hungry i lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of pastrami i walk out of the store grunting and eating pastrami the patrons in the store fear me i dont care  we are in south austin i have been drinking warm beer and singing brooks and dunn tunes for over an hour my truckmate is tired of my singing he suggests that perhaps brooks and dunn have written other good songs besides youre going to miss me when im gone and neon moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive perhaps he suggests i could just let the cd play on its own i tell him to fuck off and restart neon moon  we arrive at the erwin center my truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage i tell him hes an idiot i tell him we will never get out i tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here he ignores me i think hes still pissed about the brooks and dunn tunes i whistle neon moon loudly  i am rallying i have  warm beers stuffed in my pants were going to kick the shit out of arizona  halftime score texas  arizona  i am pleased i go to the bathroom to pee for the  time today i giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom brice there are no arizona fans in the bathroom i am disappointed i tell myself out loud that i have a niiiiiice cock no one is amused but me  i walk to the bathroom while drinking bud light out of a can needless to say they do not sell beer at the erwin center much less bud light out of a can i am stopped by an usher where did you get that sir i tell him no shit oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs would you mind throwing this away for me i take the last swig and hand it to him he is confused i pretend im going to the bathroom but i run away giggling instead i duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me i sneak into a large group of people and sit down the usher walks by harmlessly i am giggling like a little girl i crack open another can of bud light  i am lost in my haste to avoid the usher i have lost my bearings i have no ticket stub i cannot find my seats texas is losing  texas is being screwed by the refs i am enraged i have cleared out the seats around me because i keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it a concerned fan asks if im ok and perhaps i shouldnt take it so seriously i tell him to fuck off  after the fourth consecutive worst fucking call i have ever seen i attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects however on this occasion i miscalculate and i thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye i am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt perhaps i think to myself im taking this a bit seriously  i am standing in the bathroom peeing im so drunk i am swaying and grunting i have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye my pants are bloody i have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist i look like i should be in an episode of cops  texas has lost i put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits i am stopped every  seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why i am covered in blood but i merely grunt incoherently and keep moving  with my one good eye i have located the parking garage i walk up six flights of stairs promise that when i see my friend i will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck i look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving i take a nap  i awake from my nap i see my friend in the drivers seat i lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving i am too tired to punch my friend i call my friend a stupid fuck  i lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all

second floor i jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below my friend looks at me like i just anally violated his minor sister i turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to neon moon  we are moving we are out of beer i jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers i am happy i return to my vehicle  we have emerged from the parking facility we make our way to my apartment and find ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him we are all going to die tonight  we have finished threequarters of the bottle of glenlivet we decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at pollyesthers ed has to pee he walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces we giggle uncontrollably and leave for pollyesthers  the pollyesthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter ive been working this door for almost a year ive been working doors in this town for almost  years and i can honestly say that i aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three sorry cant let you in we attempt to reason with him he laughs harder  we find a bar that lets us in we take two steps in the door and hear last call for alcohol i turn to the group and mutter see dat wasnt that fuckin hard day dont fuckin do that at the awamothe awaomthe alabfuck

reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings  the food arrives we are all asleep with our heads on the table the waiter wakes us up we eat

bulletin from the texas tourism bureau the new texas white house in crawford texas will soon be drawing a numberof people to that area and other areas of the south including many who are not used to southern hospitality like yankee liberal reporters they might find useful the following travel advice issued by the texas   tourism bureau to all visiting northerners and northeastern urbanites      dont order filet mignon or pasta primavera at waffle house its    just a diner they serve breakfast  hours a day let them cook   something    they know if you confuse them theyll kick your ass      dont laugh at our southern names merleen bodie bubby bobby   ray tammy lynn billy joe sissy clovis etc or we will just hav e to   kick your ass         dont order a bottle of pop or a can of soda down here down here its called coke nobody gives a damn whether its pepsi rc dr   pepper  or whatever  its still a coke accept it doing  otherwise can   lead to an ass kicking         we know our heritage most of us are more literate than you eg welty williams faulkner we are also better educated and generall y a lot nicer dont refer to us as a bunch of hillbillies or eell kick your ass         we have plenty of business sense eg fred smith of fed ex   turner broadcasting mci worldcom mtv netscape dell computers  naturally we do sometimes have small lapses in judgment eg carter duke barnes clinton we dont care if you think we are dumb we are not dumb enough to let someone move to   our state in order to run for the senate if someone tried to do that we   would certainly kick their ass         dont laugh at our civil war monuments if lee had listened to    longstreet and flanked meade at gettysburg instead of sending pickett up the middle youd be paying taxes to richmond instead of washington          we are fully aware of how hot the weather is in august so  shut the hell   up just spend your money and get the hell out of here or well kick  your ass         dont order wheat toast at cracker barrel everyone will instantly know that youre a yankee eat your biscuits like god intendedwith   gravy and dont put sugar on your grits or well kick your ass         dont talk about how much better things are at home because w e   know better many of us have visited northern hellholes like detroit   chicago and dc and we have the scars and the notches on our pistols  to prove it if you dont like it here  delta is ready when you are move your ass on home before it gets  kicked up between your shoulders and you have to take off your shirt to shit         yes we know how to speak proper english we talk this way   because we dont want to sound like you we dont care if you dont understand what we are saying all other southerners understand what we are   sayingand thats all that matters now go away and leave us alone o r wellkick your ass         dont complain that the south is dirty and polluted none o f our lakes or rivers have caught fire recently if you whine about our   scenic beauty well kick your ass all the way back to boston harbor         dont ridicule our southern manners we say sir and maam we   hold doors open for others we offer our seats to old folks because such   things are expected of civilized people behave yourselves around our  sweet    little greyhaired grandmothers or theyll kick some manners into your   ass just like they did ours         so you think were quaint or losers because most of us live in   the countryside thats because we have enough sense to not live in filthy smelly crimeinfested cesspools like new york or baltimore make fun of our fresh air and well kick your sorry ass         nothing in california is southern so if you come down here dont    think youre one of us just because you say youre from southern    california your mexicans didnt invent low riders ours did and the   food is tex mex it isnt cal mex you havent contributed anything to   south so dont try to take or well kick your ass         last but not least do not dare to come down here and tell us   how to barbecue this will get your ass shot right after it is kicked  youre lucky we let you come down here at all criticize our barbeque and

football    this one should remind you guys of our sojourn to new orleans last fall  it takes a while to read but its worth it j      fan on game day apologies if youve seen this beforeworth another  look  this is pretty long but its hysterical if youve ever been drunk at a  sporting event or been with someone who has you can relate      this is an email from some guy named jd horne who according to the  messages that were attached to this is not a  yearold frat boy but an  attorney of indeterminate age he sent it to his friend brian brice and it  got forwarded around the country you have to give the guy some props for  being selfdeprecatingbut i hope i never meet him on game day  a chronology of events for saturday december   and the early morning  hours of sunday december      arise play the eyes of texas and texas fight at fullfreaking blast   get in car drive to new braunfels   tee off me and a buddy were the first teetime of the morning   turn  crack open first beer   crack open second beer   crack openyou get the idea   finish  holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth    headed for san antonio alamodome  nebraska vs texas   buy three  for pre and postgame festivities   we decide we dont have enough booze so we doubleback to a liquor  store and buy the good ol  ml plastic bottle traveler jim beam   arrive at the tailgate spot awesome day not a single cloud in the  sky about  degrees   i decide that were going to kick the shit out of nebraska   i tell my first nebraska fan to go fuck himself   the ut band walks by on the way to the alamodome were on the second  floor of a twostory parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us  were hooting and hollering like wildmen the band doubles back to the  street right below us and serenades us with texas fight and the eyes of  texas awesome moment   in the postserenade serendipity  grown men are bumping chests  with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the  fact that we are going to kick the shit out of nebraska   the nebraska band walks by on the way to the alamodome again we hoot  and holler like wildmen again the band doubles back and stops right below  us to serenade us this time however with the nebraska fight songs  although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced  that we are going to kick the shit out of nebraska   i begin the walk to the alamodome somehow managing to stuff the  traveler and  cans of beer into my pants   i am in line surrounded by nebraska fans they are taunting me i am  taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of  nebraska i decide to challenge a particularly vocal nebraska fan to play  what i now call and will forever be remembered as cellphone flop out  remember flop out for a dollar the rules are similar i tell this  nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out  his cell phone right now and make plane reservations to phoenix for the  fiesta bowl and then i spoke these memorable words and not those damn  refundable tickets either you request those nonrefundable  nontransferrable sonsofbitches he backs down he is unworthy  i call southwest airlines and buy two tickets to phoenix nonrefundable and  nontransferrable price  he is humbled he lowers his head in  shame i raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of texas  fans i am king and these are my subjects i distribute the  beers in my  pants to the cheering masses i rule the pregame kingdom   kickoff brimming with confidence i open the traveler and pour my  first stiffy   i notice something troubling nebraska is big nebraska is fast  nebraska is very pissed off at texas   the first quarter mercifully ends  yards total offense for texas  zero first downs for texas im still talking shit i pour another stiffy  from the traveler   four minutes to go in the first half the traveler is a dead soldier  i buy my first  beer from the alamodome merchants while i am standing in  line a center snap nearly decapitates major applewhite and rolls out of the  end zone safety   halftime score nebraska  texas  i wish i had another traveler   while urinating next to a nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime i  attempt to revive the classic briceism from the south bend bathroom  hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock he is unamused   i buy my  and   beer from the alamodome merchants i share my  beer with two high school girls sitting behind me surprisingly they are  equipped with a flask full of vodka i send them off to purchase sprites  so that we may consume their vodka i have not lost faith  nebraska is a bunch of pussies   no more vodka the girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives  i purchase two more  beers from the alamodome merchants   score is nebraska  texas  i am beginning to lose faith this  normally would trouble me but i am too drunk to see the football field   i call southwest airlines im sorry sir those tickets have been  confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable   i try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter  as it turns out the alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when  there is less than  minutes on the game clock i am enraged by this  policy i ask loudly why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the  fucking pa system   back in my seats i am slumped in my chair in defeat all of a sudden  the texas crowd goes absolutely nuts  whazzis i mutter awaking from my coma iz we winnig did wez scort  alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score the  largest by far cheer of the day from the texas faithful occurred when the  handlers were walking back to the tunnel and bevo the texas mascot stopped  to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters s k and a in the  nebraska spelled out in their end zone i cheer wildly i pick up the  empty traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it i am thirsty   nebraska fans are going berserk as i walk back to the truck i would  taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but i am too  drunk to form complete sentences with my last cognitive thought of the  evening i take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in  october they would be playing florida state for the national championship   back in the car on the way back to austin for the basketball game   texasarizona tip off we can still salvage the day i crack open a  beer it is warm i dont care   we have stopped for gas i am hungry i go inside the store i walk  past the beer frig i notice a zima ive never had a zima i wonder if  its any good i pull a zima from the frig i twist the top off and drink  the zima in three swallows zima sucks i replace the empty bottle in the  frig   there is a blimpie subs in the store i walk to where the ingredients  are where the person usually makes the sub there is no one there i lean  over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives i eat them  i am still hungry i lean further over the counter and grab approximately  two pounds of pastrami i walk out of the store grunting and eating  pastrami the patrons in the store fear me i dont care   we are in south austin i have been drinking warm beer and singing  brooks and dunn tunes for over an hour my truckmate is tired of my  singing he suggests that perhaps brooks and dunn have written other good  songs besides youre going to miss me when im gone  and neon moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times  each was a bit excessive perhaps he suggests i could just let the cd  play on its own i tell him to fuck off and restart neon moon   we arrive at the erwin center my truckmate against my loud and  profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage i  tell him hes an idiot i tell him we will never get out i tell him we  may as well pitch a fucking tent here he ignores me  i think hes still pissed about the brooks and dunn tunes i whistle neon  moon loudly   i am rallying i have  warm beers stuffed in my pants were going  to kick the shit out of arizona   halftime score texas  arizona  i am pleased i go to the  bathroom to pee for the  time today i giggle to myself because of the  new opportunity to do the bathroom brice there are no arizona fans in  the bathroom i am disappointed i tell myself out loud that i have a  niiiiiice cock no one is amused but me   i walk to the bathroom while drinking bud light out of a can needless  to say they do not sell beer at the erwin centermuch less bud light out of  a can i am stopped by an usher where did you get that sir i tell him  no shit oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little  plastic footballs would you mind throwing this away for me i take the  last swig and hand it to him he is confused i pretend im going to the  bathroom but i run away giggling instead i duck into some entrance to  avoid the usher who is now pursuing me i sneak into a large group of  people and sit down the usher walks by harmlessly i am giggling like a  little girl i crack open another can of bud light   i am lost in my haste to avoid the usher i have lost my bearings i  have no ticket stub i cannot find my seats texas is losing   texas is being screwed by the refs i am enraged i have cleared out  the seats around me because i keep removing my hat and beating the  surrounding chairs with it a concerned fan asks if im ok and perhaps i  shouldnt take it so seriously i tell him to fuck off   after the fourth consecutive worst fucking call i have ever seen i  attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects  however on this occasion i miscalculate and i thumbnail myself in my left  eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye i am now bleeding into  my left eye and all over my shirt perhaps i think to myself im  taking this a bit seriously   i am standing in the bathroom peeing im so drunk i am swaying and  grunting i have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye my pants are  bloody i have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist i look  like i should be in an episode of cops   texas has lost i put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make  my way for the exits i am stopped every  seconds by a good  samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why i am covered in blood but i  merely grunt incoherently and keep moving   with my one good eye i have located the parking garage i walk up  six flights of stairs promise that when i see my friend i will punch him in  the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and  collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck i look around and notice that  traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no  one is moving i take a nap   i awake from my nap i see my friend in the drivers seat i lift my  head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up  all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving i  am too tired to punch my friend i call my friend a stupid cocksucker   i lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that  traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and

out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility  and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below  my friend looks at me like i just anally violated his minor sister i turn  around pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to neon  moon   we are moving we are out of beer i jump from the truck and go from  vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers i am happy i return  to my vehicle   we have emerged from the parking facility we make our way to my  apartment and find ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of  glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him we are all going to die  tonight   we have finished threequarters of the bottle of glenlivet we decide  it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at pollyesthers ed has to pee  he walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length  mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces we  giggle uncontrollably and leave for pollyesthers   the pollyesthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter  his club fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter ive  been working this door for almost a year ive been working doors in this  town for almost  years and i can honestly say that i aint never seen  three drunker mother fuckers than you three sorry cant let you in we  attempt to reason with him he laughs harder   we find a bar that lets us in we take two steps in the door and hear  last call for alcohol i turn to the group and mutter see dat wasnt  that fuckin hard day dont fuckin do that at the awamothe awaomthe

frat boy but an  attorney of indeterminate age he sent it to his friend brian brice and it  got forwarded around the country you have to give the guy some props for  being selfdeprecatingbut i hope i never meet him on game day  a chronology of events for saturday december   and the early morning  hours of sunday december      arise play the eyes of texas and texas fight at fullfreaking blast   get in car drive to new braunfels   tee off me and a buddy were the first teetime of the morning   turn  crack open first beer   crack open second beer   crack openyou get the idea   finish  holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth    headed for san antonio alamodome  nebraska vs texas   buy three  for pre and postgame festivities   we decide we dont have enough booze so we doubleback to a liquor  store and buy the good ol  ml plastic bottle traveler jim beam   arrive at the tailgate spot awesome day not a single cloud in the  sky about  degrees   i decide that were going to kick the shit out of nebraska   i tell my first nebraska fan to go fuck himself   the ut band walks by on the way to the alamodome were on the second  floor of a twostory parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us  were hooting and hollering like wildmen the band doubles back to the  street right below us and serenades us with texas fight and the eyes of  texas awesome moment   in the postserenade serendipity  grown men are bumping chests  with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the  fact that we are going to kick the shit out of nebraska   the nebraska band walks by on the way to the alamodome again we hoot  and holler like wildmen again the band doubles back and stops right below  us to serenade us this time however with the nebraska fight songs  although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced  that we are going to kick the shit out of nebraska   i begin the walk to the alamodome somehow managing to stuff the  traveler and  cans of beer into my pants   i am in line surrounded by nebraska fans they are taunting me i am  taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of  nebraska i decide to challenge a particularly vocal nebraska fan to play  what i now call and will forever be remembered as cellphone flop out  remember flop out for a dollar the rules are similar i tell this  nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out  his cell phone right now and make plane reservations to phoenix for the  fiesta bowl and then i spoke these memorable words and not those damn  refundable tickets either you request those nonrefundable  nontransferrable sonsofbitches he backs down he is unworthy  i call southwest airlines and buy two tickets to phoenix nonrefundable and  nontransferrable price  he is humbled he lowers his head in  shame i raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of texas  fans i am king and these are my subjects i distribute the  beers in my  pants to the cheering masses i rule the pregame kingdom   kickoff brimming with confidence i open the traveler and pour my  first stiffy   i notice something troubling nebraska is big nebraska is fast  nebraska is very pissed off at texas   the first quarter mercifully ends  yards total offense for texas  zero first downs for texas im still talking shit i pour another stiffy  from the traveler   four minutes to go in the first half the traveler is a dead soldier  i buy my first  beer from the alamodome merchants while i am standing in  line a center snap nearly decapitates major applewhite and rolls out of the  end zone safety   halftime score nebraska  texas  i wish i had another traveler   while urinating next to a nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime i  attempt to revive the classic briceism from the south bend bathroom  hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock he is unamused   i buy my  and   beer from the alamodome merchants i share my  beer with two high school girls sitting behind me surprisingly they are  equipped with a flask full of vodka i send them off to purchase sprites  so that we may consume their vodka i have not lost faith  nebraska is a bunch of pussies   no more vodka the girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives  i purchase two more  beers from the alamodome merchants   score is nebraska  texas  i am beginning to lose faith this  normally would trouble me but i am too drunk to see the football field   i call southwest airlines im sorry sir those tickets have been  confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable   i try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter  as it turns out the alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when  there is less than  minutes on the game clock i am enraged by this  policy i ask loudly why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the  fucking pa system   back in my seats i am slumped in my chair in defeat all of a sudden  the texas crowd goes absolutely nuts  whazzis i mutter awaking from my coma iz we winnig did wez scort  alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score the  largest by far cheer of the day from the texas faithful occurred when the  handlers were walking back to the tunnel and bevo the texas mascot stopped  to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters s k and a in the  nebraska spelled out in their end zone i cheer wildly i pick up the  empty traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it i am thirsty   nebraska fans are going berserk as i walk back to the truck i would  taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but i am too  drunk to form complete sentences with my last cognitive thought of the  evening i take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in  october they would be playing florida state for the national championship   back in the car on the way back to austin for the basketball game   texasarizona tip off we can still salvage the day i crack open a  beer it is warm i dont care   we have stopped for gas i am hungry i go inside the store i walk  past the beer frig i notice a zima ive never had a zima i wonder if  its any good i pull a zima from the frig i twist the top off and drink  the zima in three swallows zima sucks i replace the empty bottle in the  frig   there is a blimpie subs in the store i walk to where the ingredients  are where the person usually makes the sub there is no one there i lean  over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives i eat them  i am still hungry i lean further over the counter and grab approximately  two pounds of pastrami i walk out of the store grunting and eating  pastrami the patrons in the store fear me i dont care   we are in south austin i have been drinking warm beer and singing  brooks and dunn tunes for over an hour my truckmate is tired of my  singing he suggests that perhaps brooks and dunn have written other good  songs besides youre going to miss me when im gone  and neon moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times  each was a bit excessive perhaps he suggests i could just let the cd  play on its own i tell him to fuck off and restart neon moon   we arrive at the erwin center my truckmate against my loud and  profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage i  tell him hes an idiot i tell him we will never get out i tell him we  may as well pitch a fucking tent here he ignores me  i think hes still pissed about the brooks and dunn tunes i whistle neon  moon loudly   i am rallying i have  warm beers stuffed in my pants were going  to kick the shit out of arizona   halftime score texas  arizona  i am pleased i go to the  bathroom to pee for the  time today i giggle to myself because of the  new opportunity to do the bathroom brice there are no arizona fans in  the bathroom i am disappointed i tell myself out loud that i have a  niiiiiice cock no one is amused but me   i walk to the bathroom while drinking bud light out of a can needless  to say they do not sell beer at the erwin centermuch less bud light out of  a can i am stopped by an usher where did you get that sir i tell him  no shit oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little  plastic footballs would you mind throwing this away for me i take the  last swig and hand it to him he is confused i pretend im going to the  bathroom but i run away giggling instead i duck into some entrance to  avoid the usher who is now pursuing me i sneak into a large group of  people and sit down the usher walks by harmlessly i am giggling like a  little girl i crack open another can of bud light   i am lost in my haste to avoid the usher i have lost my bearings i  have no ticket stub i cannot find my seats texas is losing   texas is being screwed by the refs i am enraged i have cleared out  the seats around me because i keep removing my hat and beating the  surrounding chairs with it a concerned fan asks if im ok and perhaps i  shouldnt take it so seriously i tell him to fuck off   after the fourth consecutive worst fucking call i have ever seen i  attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects  however on this occasion i miscalculate and i thumbnail myself in my left  eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye i am now bleeding into  my left eye and all over my shirt perhaps i think to myself im  taking this a bit seriously   i am standing in the bathroom peeing im so drunk i am swaying and  grunting i have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye my pants are  bloody i have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist i look  like i should be in an episode of cops   texas has lost i put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make  my way for the exits i am stopped every  seconds by a good  samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why i am covered in blood but i  merely grunt incoherently and keep moving   with my one good eye i have located the parking garage i walk up  six flights of stairs promise that when i see my friend i will punch him in  the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and  collapse in a heap in the bed of the

back to me i know this is too true and so dreadful oprah actually had a show about this atrocity this is an actual petition and signatures will be lost if you drop the line please take  minutes out of your life to do your part madhu the government of afghanistan is waging a war upon women since the taliban took power in  women have had to wear burqua and have been beaten and stoned in public for not having the proper attire even if this means simply not having the mesh covering in front of their eyes one woman was beaten to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists for accidentally exposing her arm while she was driving another was stoned to death for trying to leave the country with a man that was not a relative women are not allowed to work or even go out in public without a male relative professional women such as professors translators doctors lawyers artists and writers have been forced from their jobs and restricted to their homes homes where a woman is present must have their windows painted so that she can never be seen by outsiders they must wear silent shoes so that they are never heard women live in fear of their lives for the slightest misbehavior because they cannot work those without male relatives or husbands are either starving to death or begging the street even if they hold phds depression is becoming so widespread that it has reached emergency levels there is no way in such an extreme islamic society to know the suicide rate with certainty but relief workers are estimating that the suicide rate among women must be extraordinarily high those who cannot find proper medication and treatment for severe depression and would rather take their lives than live in such conditions at one of the rare hospitals for women a reporter found still nearly lifeless bodies lying motionless on top of beds wrapped in their bur qua unwilling to speak eat or do anything but slowly wasting away others have gone mad and were seen crouched in corners perpetually rocking or crying most of them in fear when what little medication that is left finally runs out one doctor is considering leaving these women in front of the presidents residence as a form of protest it is at the point where the term human rights violations has become an understatement husbands have the power of life and death over their women relatives especially their wives but an angry mob has just as much right to stone or beat a woman often to death for exposing an inch of flesh or offending them in the slightest way women enjoyed relative freedom to work to dress generally as they wanted and to drive and appear in public alone until only  the rapidity of this transition is the main reason for the depression and suicide women who were once educators or doctors or simply used to basic human freedoms are now severely restricted and treated as subhuman in the name of rightwing fundamentalist islam it is not their tradition or culture but it is alien to them and it is extreme even for those cultures where fundamentalism is the rule everyone has a right to a tolerable human existence even if they are women in a muslim country if we can threaten military force in kosovo the name of human rights for the sake of ethnic albanians citizens of the world can certainly express peaceful outrage at the oppression murder and injustice committed against women by the taliban statement in signing this we agree that the current treatment of women in afghanistan is completely unacceptable and deserves action by the united nations and that the current situation overseas will not be tolerated womens rights is not a small issue anywhere and it is unacceptable for women in  to be treated as subhuman and as so much property equality and human decency is a fundamental right not a freedom to be granted whether one lives in afghanistan or elsewhere  giuliana d black daly citycausa  mariam nayiny palo altocausa  sunaina gulatiruh palo altocausa  megan

brew down below as much   as we   try to convince ourselves the work poop is inevitable for those of   you   who hate pooping at work as much as i do i give you the      survival guide for taking a dump at work   memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure   pleasure     escapee   definition a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or   forcing poop in a stall this is usually accompanied by a sudden wave   of   panicembarrassment this is similar to the hot flash you receive when   passing an unseen police car and speeding if you release an escapee   do   not acknowledge it pretend it did not happen if you are standing   next to   the farter at the urinal pretend that you did not hear it no one   likes an   escapee it is uncomfortable for all involved making a joke or   laughing   makes both parties feel uneasy     jailbreak used in conjunction with escapee definition when forcing   poop   several farts slip out at a machine guns pace this is usually a side   effect   of diarrhea or a hangover if this should happen do not panic remain   in the   stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the   awkwardness of what just occurred     courtesy flush   definition the act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone   of the   poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed   location this reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink   up the   bathroom this can help you avoid being caught doing the walk of   shame     walk of shame   definition walking from the stall to the sink to the door after you   have   just stunkup the bathroom this can be a very uncomfortable moment   if   someone walks in as with all farts it is best to pretend that the   smell   does not exist     out of the closet pooper   definition a colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it   you will   often see an out of the closet pooper enter the bathroom with a   newspaper or   magazine under their arm always look around the office for the out   of the   closet pooper before entering the bathroom     the pooping friends network pfn   definition a group of coworkers who band together to ensure   emergency   pooping goes off without incident this group can help you to   monitor the   whereabouts of out of the closet poopers and identify safe havens     safe haven   definition a seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where   you can   least expect visitors try floors that are predominantly of the   opposite   sex this will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the   bathroom     turd burglar   definition a pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall   and   tries to force the door open this is one of the most shocking and   vulnerable moments that occur when work taking a dump at work if   this   occurs remain in the stall until the turd burg leaves this way you   will   avoid all uncomfortable eye contact     camocough   definition a phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the   bathroom   that you are in a stall this can be used to coverup a watermelon or   to   alert potential turd burglars very effective when used in   conjunction with   an astaire     astaire   definition a subtle toetap that is used to alert potential turd   burglars   that you are occupying a stall this will remove all doubt that the   stall   is occupied if you hear an astaire leave the bathroom immediately   so the   pooper can poop in peace     watermelon   definition a turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet   water   this is also an embarrassing incident if you feel a watermelon   coming on   create a diversion see camocough     havana omelet   definition a load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes   in   the toilet water often accompanied by an escapee try using a   camocough   with an astaire     uncle ted   definition a bathroom user who seems to linger around forever   could   spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on   the pot   an uncle ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper as you   should   always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty this   benefits you   as well as the other bathroom attendees     fly by   definition the act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping walk   in   check for other poopers if there are others in the bathroom leave   and   come back again be careful not to become a frequent flyer people   may   become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the   bathroom     crack
